Player attributes (e.g., age, gender, experience, newsletter subscription) were collected via on-boarding forms; session timing and play duration come from server logs.

    "I will use a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model to predict whether a player subscribes to the newsletter (subscribe) using predictors such as played_hours, experience, and age.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why KNN is Appropriate:\n",
    "KNN is a non-parametric model that classifies observations based on the majority class among their closest neighbors in feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It works well for classification problems where relationships may be nonlinear.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model’s simplicity and interpretability make it ideal for an introductory data science project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It aligns with DSCI 100 course concepts and is easy to implement and tune with tidymodels.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Data Preprocessing Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "Construct a tidymodels workflow for reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recipe steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) – convert categorical variables (e.g., experience, gender) to numeric.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) – standardize numeric predictors for meaningful distance calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. step_zv() – remove zero-variance predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. step_impute_mean(all_numeric_predictors()) – handle any missing numeric values.\n",
    "\n",
    "If class imbalance affects results, apply step_upsample(newsletter_subscribed) to balance the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Data Splitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Split the data once at the start:\n",
    "\n",
    "initial_split(players, prop = 0.75, strata = newsletter_subscribed)\n",
    "\n",
    "Training set: 75%  Testing set: 25%\n",
    "\n",
    "Use 5-fold cross-validation on the training data to tune the number of neighbors (neighbors = c(1, 3, 5, …, 51)).\n",
    "\n",
    "##Model Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluate model performance with:\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy – overall correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Balanced Accuracy – accounts for class imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROC AUC – measures ranking and discrimination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Select the best K based on highest balanced accuracy or ROC AUC, then test on the held-out data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations & Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumes nearby players in feature space have similar outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensitive to feature scaling, irrelevant predictors, and class imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computationally expensive for large datasets (but feasible here).\n",
    "\n",
    "Boundaries can be noisy; model performance depends on the chosen K."
